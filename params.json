{"body":"## What is Tape?\r\n\r\nTape is a lightweight data mapping library.\r\n\r\nIt was specifically designed as a fluent API over JDBC for simple CRUD operations.\r\n\r\n## Why Tape?\r\n\r\nSo that I could write persistence code using plain old JDBC instead of having to use an heavyweight ORM framework.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nTape is designed to be:\r\n* Lightweight - without any dependency\r\n* Small - easy to understand in a short amount of time\r\n* Transparent - without magic happening behind the the scenes\r\n* Fast to setup and fire - so your database integration tests run fast\r\n* Easy to get started with\r\n\r\nTape is not:\r\n* An Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. There are already good ORM frameworks available\r\n* An abstraction over SQL. The intention is to retain the simplicity and power of SQL as a language\r\n* An object-oriented language over SQL\r\n* A code generation framework. It does not try to generate Java representations of your database schema. You have to do that yourself.\r\n\r\nThe intention is simply to make it easier to work with JDBC for typical CRUD scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What does it look like?\r\n\r\nFollowing is a simple illustration of how Tape may be used.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Describe the mapping for Items and Products\r\nTable<Product> products = ...\r\nTable<Item> items = ...\r\n\r\n// Select all items whose product name is 'Bulldog' using the given connection\r\nList<Item> bulldogs = Select.from(items).\r\n                          join(products, \"items.product_id = products.id\").\r\n                          where(\"products.name = ?\", \"Bulldog\").\r\n                          list(connection);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Learn More\r\n\r\nFor further details and other examples, head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/testinfected/tape/wiki) or take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/testinfected/tape/blob/master/src/test/java/com/vtence/tape).\r\n","google":"UA-16545808-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

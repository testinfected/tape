There are already good ORM frameworks available\r\n* An abstraction over SQL. The intention is to retain the simplicity and power of SQL as a language\r\n* An object-oriented language over SQL\r\n* A code generation framework. It does not try to generate Java representations of your database schema. You have to do that yourself.\r\n\r\nThe intention is simply to make it fun and easy to write data access code without the need to resort to an ORM framework.\r\n\r\n## Learn More\r\n\r\nFor further details and other examples, head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/testinfected/tape/wiki) or take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/testinfected/tape/blob/master/src/test/java/com/vtence/tape).\r\n","google":"UA-16545808-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
